    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>ThreadCatch Browser Extension</strong></p>

    <p>Good Llama, LLC ("we" or "us") understands that your privacy is important to you and is committed to being transparent about its practices and the technologies it uses. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and security of personal information about our current and prospective users and customers. This Privacy Policy applies to the ThreadCatch browser extension ("Extension") and related services. We have developed this Privacy Policy so that you can understand the way we collect, use, and share information collected through the Extension or in connection with it.</p>

    <div class="notice">
        BY INSTALLING OR USING THE EXTENSION, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SHALL BE PROCESSED AND TREATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
    </div>

    <h2>HOW AND WHY DO WE OBTAIN INFORMATION?</h2>

    <p>We take great care to protect personal information about you and when we use it, we do so with respect for your privacy. In addition to any purpose for which we notify you before collecting personal data, we use the information we collect to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>provide, personalize, maintain, and improve our Services;</li>
        <li>maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our Services and users;</li>
        <li>provide customer support;</li>
        <li>authenticate your access to ThreadCatch services;</li>
        <li>deliver approved response content to your browser for posting;</li>
        <li>track posting activity and success rates;</li>
        <li>communicate with our users for service-related purposes;</li>
        <li>keep our Extension and services safe and secure; and</li>
        <li>comply with our legal requirements and obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>

    <p><strong>Information You Provide</strong> – When you connect the Extension to your ThreadCatch account, you provide your API key. This key is used solely to authenticate requests to our servers and retrieve your approved responses.</p>

    <p><strong>Extension Settings</strong> – The Extension stores your preferences locally in your browser, including settings for auto-close behavior and auto-posting options. These settings remain on your device and are not transmitted to our servers.</p>

    <p><strong>Usage Information</strong> – When you use the Extension to post responses, we record that the posting was successful or failed, along with relevant identifiers (such as the Reddit comment ID for successful posts). This helps us provide you with accurate reporting and improve our services.</p>

    <p><strong>Log Information</strong> – Our servers may automatically record certain information when the Extension communicates with our services. This may include your IP address, the date and time of your request, and information about the success or failure of operations.</p>

    <h2>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE NOT COLLECT?</h2>

    <p>The Extension does not collect, access, store, or transmit:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Your Reddit username or password;</li>
        <li>Your Reddit authentication cookies or session tokens;</li>
        <li>Your browsing history outside of ThreadCatch-related activities;</li>
        <li>Content from Reddit pages other than what is necessary to post your approved responses;</li>
        <li>Any sensitive personal information or special category data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We do not sell personal information to third parties, and do not share personal information with third parties, except with users' consent or as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>HOW DOES THE EXTENSION INTERACT WITH REDDIT?</h2>

    <p>When you use the Extension to post a response to Reddit:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The Extension opens the relevant Reddit page in your browser;</li>
        <li>The Extension uses your existing Reddit browser session (you must be logged into Reddit);</li>
        <li>The response text is entered into Reddit's comment form using browser automation;</li>
        <li>The post is submitted using your Reddit account credentials that are already active in your browser;</li>
        <li>We never access, intercept, or store your Reddit login credentials.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Reddit will see the post as originating from your browser and your IP address, as if you had typed and submitted the comment yourself.</p>

    <h2>HOW DO WE SHARE INFORMATION?</h2>

    <p><strong>Subsidiaries, Affiliates, and Members</strong> – We may share information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and members where it is necessary to meet the purpose for which you have submitted your personal data and in particular if necessary for the provision of services, account administration, and/or sales, marketing and support.</p>

    <p><strong>Third Parties</strong> – We may partner with third parties to provide various products and services. We may also share information to third-party contractors and providers that perform certain functions on behalf of us, such as cloud hosting services. These third parties only have access to such information as necessary to perform their functions and may not use it for any purpose other than to provide services to us.</p>

    <p><strong>Legal</strong> – We may share information directly relevant to investigating and handling a criminal or civil lawsuit or to take action to prevent fraud, abuse or other violations of our services and terms.</p>

    <h2>HOW DO WE SAFEGUARD INFORMATION?</h2>

    <p>We consider the protection of personal information to be a foundation of customer trust and a sound business practice. We employ physical, electronic, and procedural controls and safeguards and we regularly adapt these controls to respond to changing requirements and advances in technology.</p>

    <p>The Extension stores your API key and settings using Chrome's secure storage API, which provides encryption and isolation from other extensions and websites. All communications between the Extension and our servers use HTTPS encryption.</p>

    <h2>HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN INFORMATION?</h2>

    <p>We will retain your information for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. Data stored locally by the Extension remains on your device until you disconnect your account or uninstall the Extension.</p>

    <p>Server-side data related to your posting activity is retained in accordance with our general data retention policies and may be kept for as long as your ThreadCatch account is active or as needed to provide services to you.</p>

    <h2>HOW MAY INFORMATION BE ACCESSED AND CONTROLLED?</h2>

    <p>You have the following rights concerning your personal information and/or data:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right Of Access</strong> - The right to know whether data concerning you is being processed and if so, the right to gain access to it with a few exceptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Right To Rectification</strong> - The right to ensure data held about you is accurate, and if it is not, to have it corrected.</li>
        <li><strong>Right To Erasure Or Right To Be Forgotten</strong> - The right to be forgotten or have information erased, provided we do not have an overriding legal basis to retain your personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>Right To Restrict Processing</strong> - The right to limit how your personal information is processed, provided we do not have an overriding legal basis to continue processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Right To Be Informed</strong> - We have a responsibility to provide you with the information contained in this privacy notice and to answer questions if you ask for more detail.</li>
        <li><strong>Right To Data Portability</strong> - The right to obtain a copy of the personal data you provided to us, in a format you can easily take away.</li>
        <li><strong>Right To Object</strong> - The right to withdraw consent or object to processing when processing is based upon consent or legitimate interest as the lawful basis.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To delete data stored by the Extension, click "Disconnect Account" in the Extension settings. This will remove your API key and all locally stored preferences. Uninstalling the Extension will also remove all locally stored data.</p>

    <h2>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

    <p>We may occasionally update this policy. Use of our services after an update constitutes consent to the updated notice to the extent permitted by law. If we make significant changes, we will notify users in advance of the changes through our website or through other means, such as email. We encourage users to periodically review this notice for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
